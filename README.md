# Cplusplus-Program

In this project, I am a junior developer at a fictional company named Chada Tech. Chada Tech has international clients and wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock. It is my responsibility to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code. In this project what I did particularly well was my input on my inline comments. I went through step by step on each line of my code and explained exactly what each function was doing. I could enhance my code by giving each function one purpose or using more descriptive names. These changes would allow my code to be easier to read for a non-technical person. The piece of code I found most challenging to write would be the 24-hour clock format. I overcame this obstacle by slowing down and really understanding the correct functions and syntax. Resources I used to support my work were zybook readings. The skills from this project that will be transferable to other coursework would be the ability to code in C++. I had no experience in C++ before starting this course. I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable but constantly ran it through the Assignment feedback module provided by my course.
